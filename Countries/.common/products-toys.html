title: Exploding Kittens
description: |+
  Exploding Kittens is a card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats.

  In this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten, at which point they explode, they are dead, and they are out of the game, unless that player has a defuse card, which can defuse the Kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens.

  Exploding Kittens is the most-backed crowdfunded project ever, the most-funded game in the history of Kickstarter, and has paved the way for peace and tranquillity in the modern world.

  A family-friendly, party game for 2-5 players (up to 9 players when combined with any other deck). This is the most-backed project in Kickstarter history and all cards feature illustrations by The Oatmeal. Safety Warning: Not suitable for children under 36 months

title: Dobble Card Game
description: |+
  Dobble is a speedy observation game where players race to match the identical symbol between cards. Reliant on a sharp eye and quick reflexes, Dobble creates excitement for children and adults alike while keeping every player involved in the action. In Dobble, players compete with each other to find the matching symbol between one card and another.

  Every card is unique and has only one symbol in common with any other in the deck. The match can be difficult to spot as the size and positioning of the symbols can vary on each card. As the game is based on reactions and visual perception, rather than knowledge or strategy, there is no advantage for adults over children, making it the perfect family game. Dobble is a series of quickness-based mini-games in which all players play at the same time. You can play the mini-games in a specific order, randomly, or you can keep playing the same one over and over.

  The only important thing is to have fun! No matter which game you play, you always need to be the fastest to spot the identical symbol between two cards, name it out loud and then take the card, place it or discard it depending on the rules of the mini-game you're currently playing.
