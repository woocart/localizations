"Notes on a Nervous Planet by Matt Haig - Hardcover","<ul>
 	<li>A personal and vital look at how to feel happy, human and whole in the twenty-first century.</li>
 	<li>A view over questions like: How can we stay sane on a planet that makes us mad? How do we stay human in a technological world? How do we feel happy when we are encouraged to be anxious?</li>
</ul>","Notes on a Nervous Planet is a fascinating look at the link between anxiety and the world we live in. Matt Haig has written really something rather special here - the definitive user manual for your own head. It's a self-help book that - unusually for the genre - talks in sensible, practical terms, not in vague aphorisms and allegories.

Recommended for anyone who's ever wobbled and that's all of us. Haig's bestseller 'Reasons to Stay Alive' was an engaging self-help memoir which mined personal trauma for valuable life lessons. This follow-up is a rag-bag of personal experience, thoughts and feelings. Some thought-provoking, some pertinent and important.

Matt Haig is a smart operator who knows his readership and genuinely wants to help them. After experiencing years of anxiety and panic attacks, these questions became urgent matters of life and death for him. And he began to look for the link between what he felt and the world around him.",9.35,https://bookstore.mywoocart.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/notesnervousplanet.jpg
